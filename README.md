# retrochat

Program that renders Twitch chat to a window with an amber color scheme.

**Very much made for personal use and is very bad because I don't feel like fixing bugs here** and as such has absolutely no warranty.

Usage (after cloning the repository):

`cargo run [channel name]`

Press F11 after moving the window to your monitor to goto fullscreen, however due to a Raylib 3.x bug you will then need to use a keyboard shortcut to move the window back to that monitor.

Use scroll wheel to scroll down if a chat message is cut off.
